so i play this game called windows with my girlfriend which is super fun. the game is played like this. each player is delt 4 cards out of a shuffled deck, in the shape of a window. the two bottom cards are revealed to the player on the first, and only the first round of the game. each player then takes turns to take a card from the rest othe cards which are placed face down on the table. a player can take a card, look at it, and decide if theyd like to swap it out for one of their 4 window cards, or play it face up on the discard pile. the next player can then choose if theyd like to take off the top of the discard pile, or take from the face down remaining pile. the objective of the game is to score the least, and this is obviously done through having low cards. some cards have special abilities.
Special Abilities:
1. The joker:
-their should be two jokers in the pack, and they count toward your final score as -1
2. The red queen:
-the red queen, being the queen of diamonds and hearts, counts toward your final score as 0
3. The king:
upon playing the king the player is granted the abillity to swap a card of their choosing for an opponents card of their chosing
4. the jack: 
upon playing the jack, the player is granted the ability to swap a card of their choosing for an opponenets card of the OPPONENTS choosing.
5. the 8
upon playing an 8, a player is granted the ability to look at one of their opponents card, which is not revealed to their opponent.
6. the 6
upon playing a 6, the player is granted the ability to look at one of their own cards, which is not revealed to their opponent.
that is the extent of the special abilities, and from 3 down, the special abiliteis are only activated upon playing these cards on the face up discard pile.

stacking:
this is the most important feauture of the whole game, and it is imperative that you get this correct. a stack should be able to be activated by either player upon the playing of a card. 
how it works:
if a card is played on the discard pile by either player, either player is allowed to call a stack, and then choose any card of their choice from their 4 cards to stack upon this card. if the card is a match in the number, it is a successful stack, and the player who called the successful stack has been able to discard one of their cards, giving them an advantage, and only a pile of 3 from that point on. this is how stacking for oneself works.
however, players are able to stack for eachother. if a player used an 8 earlier in the game for example, and identified that their opponent posseses a 4, if a 4 is played on the discard pile, and the player calls stack, and chooses the correct face down card from their opponents pile, this is a successful attacking stack, and the player is able to give the opponent a card of their choosing, freeing up a slot for themselves. 
now importantly, if the number does not match, and the stack is unsusccesful in either stack variation, the player who has called the stack incorrectly must take a card from the face down pile, and are NOT allowed to look at it. meaning if you had 4 cards, and called an unsucsessful stack, you will now have 5 cards, and that can keep going indefinitely if the player continues to call incorrect stacks. 

i want to be able to play this game on a simple web app against my girlfriend online, the way it should work is it should be a birds eye view of a table with each players hand, and each player should have a stack button on their screen. once a player has called stack, they will be required to choose the correct card. the stack button should be disabled once one player has clicked it for that turn, as in the real game its whoever says stack first.
